# OCT-Retinal-Disease-Detection
This project presents an end-to-end medical image analysis pipeline for detecting retinal diseases from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. The system is built using a structured, research-grade workflow covering data analysis, masking &amp; segmentation, preprocessing, augmentation, deep learning model training, and explainability.
